[What it does]

    split lossless audio chunk(APE/FLAC/TTA/WAVPACK) into small FLAC pieces, according to some cuesheet.

[WARNING]

    This is currently only a home-made-toy project.

    It would be much better in the future, but NOW do not expect anything .

    Also the whole git history may be blown away, someday.
